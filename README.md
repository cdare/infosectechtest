JUST EAT Security Engineer Recruitment Test
===========================================

The test consists of two parts:

* [A code review test](#code-review-test)
* [A few technical questions](#technical-questions)

In order to avoid bounced emails we would like you to submit your results by uploading the relevant zip file to a shared Google Drive folder. In order to obtain the URL for this folder please supply your Gmail or Google-based email address to either your agent or the JUST EAT member of staff who assigned you the test.

Please make this a **single** zip file named **{yourname}-{role-applied-for}.zip** containing:

1. A single file with your findings from the code review
2. A single file with your answers to the technical questions
2. One folder containing your version of the application, if you have any suggested changes

## Code Review Test

This is a basic MVC web application that requires a security code review. Please review the application and report on any issues that you find, simple as that! Include in your report:

- Issue
- Suggested Remediation

### Rewrites

*If you are applying for a Security Sofware Engineer role, it would be advisable to do this*

If you like, you could rewrite any parts of the application that you feel could be improved. If you do so, please clearly comment on:

- If the change relates to a finding in your report
- How you made it better

You can document the changes how ever you prefer, as long as your motivation and the specific changes are clear

# Technical questions

Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called `Answers to technical questions.md`.

1. What was your process for reviewing the application?
2. If you found any issues, what was the most severe?
3. Code review can be a very manual process, how can you give assurance that code is secure in an environment with multiple daily deployments?

####Thanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!
